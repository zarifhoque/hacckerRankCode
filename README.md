# Project Euler+ Solutions

Welcome to the Project Euler+ Solutions repository! This repository contains solutions to the first 20 problems of the Project Euler+ series hosted on HackerRank. The primary goal of this project is to focus on readability and error correction while learning the intricacies and quirks of the F# programming language.

## Overview

Project Euler+ is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. These problems are intended to be solved with computer programs. This repository provides solutions to these problems using F#, a functional-first programming language.

## Objectives

- **Readability**: Each solution is written with clear and concise code to ensure it is easy to read and understand.
- **Error Correction**: Emphasis is placed on handling potential errors and edge cases to make the solutions robust.
- **Learning F#**: This project serves as a learning resource for F# enthusiasts, highlighting the unique features and quirks of the language.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized with each problem hosted on a separate branch to be merged later. Here's an example of the structure:

/project-euler-plus-solutions
│
├── Problem1
│ ├── Problem1.fs
│ └── README.md
├── Problem2
│ ├── Problem2.fs
│ └── README.md
├── ...
├── Problem20
│ ├── Problem20.fs
│ └── README.md
└── README.md

Copy code

- Each problem's solution resides in its own directory (`Problem1`, `Problem2`, etc.), which contains the solution file (`ProblemX.fs`) and a README.md file with details specific to that problem.
- The main `README.md` file provides an overview and links to individual problem directories.
